## [Microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ)

## General Explanation

- Base of the project
	- PostgreSQL

	- Frontend with React
- Backend
- Frontend

## Setup

- docker-compose.dev.yaml (later)

- docker-compose.yaml
	- backend
		- each microservice is an app
	- PostgreSQL database
	- frontend
		- React application
		- TailwindCss


- images (not customized yet for front and back)
	- Installs python and other required packages
	- Installs and sets venv

	- Copies the starting script to the image
	- Exposes the port
	- Entrypoint (not always, depends because some things wont work directly from dockerfile)
	- CMD to run

## Pipeline

- .github folder
	- workflows
		- workflow_name.yaml
- workflow jobs
	- testing
		- need to upload artifacts 
	- building
		- need to download the uploaded artifacts
		- ceraful with the correct path
	- deploying
		- in case of react project, in github settings directory should be changed to /doc instead of root
